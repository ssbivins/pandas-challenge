I had this working an hour ago, and correctly calculate the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing, and the lowest 5 performing schools
based on the same. However, besides not completing the remainder of the steps, I had two issues:

1. Somehow I ended up with duplicate columns for % overall passing. That meant the two calculations I had done no longer worked.
2. The school type column ended up being inaccurate.

AS FOR CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM THE DATA (GIVEN WHAT I COMPLETED)

1. Charter Schools in general performed considerably better than district schools, and dominated the top five
2. The difference in math scores seemed to affect overall performance more than reading scores.
